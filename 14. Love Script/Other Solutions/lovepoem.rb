As always, when it comes to love, I turn to the poets for inspiration.

puts "How do I love thee? Shall we count like Elizabeth Barrett Browning? (y/n)"
answer = gets.chomp.downcase

count_the_ways = ["To the depth, breadth, and height soul can reach?",
	"To the level of every day's most quiet need?",
	"Freely and purely?",
	"With passion put to use in old griefs?",
	"With a love lost with our lost saints?",
	"With the breath, smiles, and tears of all my life?"
]

total_ways = count_the_ways.size
questions_asked = 0

if (answer == "y")
	while (questions_asked < total_ways)
		puts count_the_ways[questions_asked]
		questions_asked += 1
		question_answer = gets.chomp.downcase
			if (question_answer == "y")
				puts "Me too."
			else
				puts "I still love you, in at least #{questions_asked - 1} ways."
				exit
			end
		puts "That's #{questions_asked} ways."
	end
else
	puts "I love you anyway."
end
